This is a tool for fuzzy-matching the spoken words of an audiobook (mp3/ogg/flac/wav/m4a/etc),
to the text of an ebook (epub/fb2/mobi/txt/etc).

The output is a wordtiming file, one line per word,
with the words from the EBOOK, and start time in fractional seconds from the AUDIOBOOK.

The intended purpose is to allow ebook-readers to read the audiobook aloud, or audiobook players to show the text.
An implementation using these wordtiming files exists for the android version of the ebook reader, coolreader.

The external tools involved are:
  vosk - speech to text tool with optional per-word statistics (apache licensed)
  diff - GNU diff, to find the Longest Common Subsequence and align ebook-words and audiobook-words
  vosk-words-json - a simple python wrapper around vosk to print per-word statistics
  ffmpeg - convert audio files to mono WAVE for vosk
  pandoc - convert ebooks to plaintext
  cr3 - (optional) coolreader, to convert ebooks to plaintext (instead of pandoc, for better use with cr3)
  md5sum - for use in caching
  xz-utils - for LZMA compression

The script is currently unix-only, and possibly GNU/Linux only.
